        Reads data from the given file and stores the expenses in the given expenses dictionary,
        where the expense type is the key and the total expense amount for that expense is the value.

        The same expense type may appear multiple times in the given file.
        Ignores expenses with missing or invalid amounts. If a line contains both an expense type and an expense amount,
        they will be separated by a colon (:).

        This method doesnâ€™t return anything.  Rather, it updates the given expenses dictionary based
        on the expenses in the given file.

        Whitespace should be removed and blank lines should be ignored.

        Note: This method will be called twice in the main function in expenses.py with the same dictionary but different files.
